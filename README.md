# Personalized-Preception-Project

The project is about testing how different machine learning models and different computer vision technics can predict humans’ preference better with limited data and trying to find the represents from images which affect the individual’s preference most. For example, we present a cat image with two different people, one may like it because it has white hair and tip ears. However, the other one may dislike it not just because the color of hair or the shape of ears but also the face of the cat. There are so many attributes which affect a person’s feeling in particular subject’s images (house (exterior, interior), dog, cat… etc.), and this project will try to find the trend of those attributes from different images for each person and make prediction for the observers which match their own preference.

Key words: Computer Vision, Machine learning, Personalized Perception
