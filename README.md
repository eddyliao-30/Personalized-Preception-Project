# Personalized-Preception-Project

As human beings, we have our own preference on what we see, hear, and feel. It can be constructed based on personality, personal experience, unique context, and the situation at the time. For instance, beauty is a personalized  perception, and everyone has their own criteria. Some people might prefer small dogs with lots of hairs and others might prefer bigger dogs with floppy ears. So, there is an assumption we try to research with. Are we able to capture an individual's personalized perceptual preference and predict it based on limited data using machine learning? Based on the question assumption, this project focuses on researching what and how different machine learning models and different computer vision technologies can predict human preferences well with limited data. 

Key words: Computer Vision, Machine learning, Personalized Perception
